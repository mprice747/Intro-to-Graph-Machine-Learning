# RiceDatathon22_BDCWorkshop
This notebook is a detailed tutorial into the basics of graph machine learning. To motivate the materical, we will build a functional movie recommendation system using various graph machine learning techniques. First, we outline a basic recommendation system using Jaccard similarity. Next, we investigate how node embeddings created by the Node2Vec algorithm can improve our initial results. Finally, we introduce graph learning via neural networks through a simple PyTorch example.
